Profiles are StructureDefinition resources. Link to some HL7 resource on profiling.

Profiles in this implementation guide extend those in the Vulcan ePI IG.

Show how resources are put together to form an ePI Bundle.

Profiles are defined for the following resources:

* Composition
* Bundle

The profiles refer to code systems that are described in the [Code Systems](codesystems.html) page.
