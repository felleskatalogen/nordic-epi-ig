      * fragment: "A subset of the code system concepts are included in the code system resource.
                       This is a curated subset released for a specific purpose under the governance of the code system steward,

   <!-- If we use:
      * example: the IG publisher doesn't use L04AG05 when validating. L04AG05 is also not one of the "valid externally defined concepts".
      * fragment: the IG publisher doesn't use L04AG05 when validating. This resource is also not created "under the governance of the code system steward".
      * complete: the IG publisher validates L04AG05 but does not find the otherwise valid R03BA01. (Doesn't look up the terminology server since the local resource of the code system is declared as compete?)
